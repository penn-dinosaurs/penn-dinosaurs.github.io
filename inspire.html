                  It is common to see many customers carrying their children in the customer waiting room. And
  this is very inconvenient for them since they need to focus on the service or the business they
  need to do, making it hard to distribute their attention to the naughty children. However,
  usually, they could not find a safe and reliable place to leave their children. <br> <br>
  Admittedly, some options are employed to help with this problem. However, none of them
  could be feasible and effective for society. One possible option is to let the service provider,
  such as the bank and supermarkets, hire some people to take care of the children, which could
  bring too much investment. So this would be unaffordable for many small or medium
  institutions with insufficient extra money. Another option would be leaving the phone to the
  children, which is quite common nowadays since phones are almost necessary for everyone in
  this high-tech era. However, this still could not ensure 100% safety and is not feasible for
  anyone. This is because some places have a poor internet connection, which could lead to a
  failure in contacting the children. And children will get bored and try to go somewhere else for
  fun when there is no internet or poor internet, which will still bring the risk of losing the
  children. Also, some people are not wealthy enough to get a phone for each of their children,
  and giving their phone to children is also inconvenient since the customer may need to use the
  phone for the service.
  <br><br>
  Hence, a generally feasible solution to help customers take care of their children safely is in
  need.

                    The idea of the chrome dino game inspires the concept of this customer-experience
enhancement system. “ It is a play on going back to the “prehistoric age” when you had no
Wi-Fi,” says the Chrome UX engineer Edward Jung. The chrome dino game was designed for
website users to have fun when getting kicked offline, and it was deliberately kept simple and
not boring so that everyone could get a good handle on it quickly and enjoy it. As a result, the
chrome dino game was popular in countries with spotty data connections. It was so popular
that some enterprise administrators had to disable it for the school kids and employees. <br><br>
Inspired by its huge success and the problem behind it, we think this game could be perfectly
embedded in the customer-experience enhancement system we design. Firstly, it could provide
children with a way to have fun offline, reducing the risk of losing an internet connection. Also,
games are always an excellent attraction to children, and this game is simple enough that anyone
can play it without spending the time to learn the skills. <br><br>
To better reduce the safety concern and provide a reliable for the customer to take care of
their children, we also add the Pan-tilt camera and the LCD & Speaker. The pan-tilt camera is
used for person detection so that it can track the children who are playing the game. If the
camera loses sight of the children for a certain time, a warning message will be sent to the
customer so that the customer can avoid dispersing their attention to worry about their
children all the time. Children are also fascinated by these moving face tracking systems too,
which not only serve the primary purpose but also act as a fun game for children and keep
them busy. So a customer could peacefully do their purposeful work without worrying about
their children. The combined use of LCD and speaker creates a human interaction since the
children are also curious about these things and love greetings. And they could also play music
based on their preference.
